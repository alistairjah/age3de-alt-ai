    ### Notes and numbering convention ###

    Organize each group of units by civ. 
    Prefix every unit name with "alt" to avoid duplicate names
        ex: altAge0Spanish2

    The last protounit entry in protoy as of Feb 16, 2024:
        unit id: 2732
           dbid: 3307

    Age of Pirates uses:
        unit id: 20000 +

    Age of the World uses:
        unit id:  6000 +
           dbid: 10000 +

    Each civ will start sequentially in the hundreds place
    This mod will stay between 50000 - 59999 
    Use the same ID for unit id and dbid
    Each civ variant will have its own group of indexes to use

    Next Civ: 50100 - 50199
