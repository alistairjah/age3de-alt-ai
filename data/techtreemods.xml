    ### Notes and numbering convention ###

    Organize each group of techs by civ. 
    Prefix every tech name with "alt" to avoid duplicate names
        ex: altAge0Spanish2

    The last techtree entry in techtreey is 11008 as of Feb 16, 2024
    
    Age of Pirates uses 40000 - 59999
    Age of the World uses one-two additional digits. ex: 2000000, 800559

    This mod will stay between 60000 - 69999 
    Each civ variant will have its own group of indexes to use, starting sequentially in the hundreds place
    Spanish2: 60000 - 60099
    Next Civ: 60100 - 60199
